## 1. What is AngularJS?

AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework developed by Google for building dynamic web applications. It extends HTML with additional attributes and binds data to HTML using two-way data binding.

## 2. What is data binding in AngularJS?

Data binding in AngularJS enables automatic synchronization of data between the model and the view. There are two types of data binding: one-way and two-way.

Example of two-way data binding:

```html
<input type="text" ng-model="name">
<p>Hello, {{ name }}!</p>
```

## 3. What is an AngularJS directive?

Directives in AngularJS are markers on DOM elements that instruct AngularJS to attach specific behavior or functionality to that element. They can be used to create custom HTML elements or attributes.

Example of a custom directive:

```html
<my-directive></my-directive>
javascript
Copy code
app.directive('myDirective', function() {
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    template: '<h1>Hello, Directive!</h1>'
  };
});
```

## 4. Explain AngularJS directives ng-repeat and ng-if.

The ng-repeat directive is used to iterate over a collection and create a copy of a specified element for each item in the collection.

Example of ng-repeat:

```html
<ul>
  <li ng-repeat="item in items">{{ item }}</li>
</ul>
```

The ng-if directive is used to conditionally render elements based on a given expression.

Example of ng-if:

```html
<div ng-if="showElement">This element is shown conditionally.</div>
```

## 5. What is AngularJS service and how to create one?

An AngularJS service is a singleton object that provides reusable functionality across the application. Services can be created using the service method or the factory method.

Example of creating a service using the service method:

```javascript
app.service('myService', function() {
  this.sayHello = function() {
    return 'Hello from the service!';
  };
});
```

## 6. What are AngularJS filters and provide an example.

AngularJS filters allow you to format and transform data before displaying it in the view. They can be used in expressions, directives, or controllers.

Example of using the 'uppercase' filter:

```html
<p>{{ 'hello world' | uppercase }}</p> <!-- Output: HELLO WORLD -->
```

## 7. Explain the concept of dependency injection in AngularJS.

Dependency injection in AngularJS is a software design pattern that allows you to inject dependencies (services, objects, etc.) into components (controllers, services, directives) rather than creating them inside the component. It promotes code reusability, testability, and modularity.

Example of dependency injection in a controller:

```javascript
app.controller('myController', ['$scope', 'myService', function($scope, myService) {
  $scope.message = myService.sayHello();
}]);
```
